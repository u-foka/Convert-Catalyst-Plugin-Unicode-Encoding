Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode::Encoding

    - Skip Mech tests unless TWMC is a high enough version. (RT#55302)
    - Move Pod tests to only run for module authors
    - Do encoding slightly later so that we can catch the output of 
      finalize_error. Encoding now happens before finalize_headers rather
      than before finalize.

    - Fix version number to be higher.

0.9 2010-03-07 22:50:00

        - Fix missing dependency for the tests.
        - Avoid LWP releases which break the tests by messing up unicode.

        - Decode $c->req->query_parameters, $c->req->body_parameters
        - Decode file upload filenames in parameters
        - Decode filenames in file upload objects

        - Fix bug causing Encode to segfault in some cases
        - Fix broken tests

        - Switch to Module::Install
        - Require Catalyst 5.8
        - Allow setting undef encoding (per request) to disable default of
          UTF-8
        - Don't overwrite encoding set in content types: 
            "text/html; charset=utf-8"
        - Handles the latin-1 (i.e. e-accute) case of encoding that everyone
          else forgets
        - Copy live tests from Catalyst::Plugin::Encoding
        - Fix bug with setting encoding in config (test from abraxxa)
